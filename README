# Python Solutions to Andrew Ng’s Coursera Problem Set

After a decade in experimental condensed matter physics, I am testing the waters of data science. After working on my first data analytics “project” where the goal was to teach myself some basic Python, I turned my attention to Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera.  

Here, I work through all the problem sets from linear regression to collaborative filtering using python3 in a Jupyter Notebook. After performing some initial exploratory data analysis, I first implement the “brute force” or manual versions of the algorithms as per the exercise prompts. I also implement various machine learning approaches using sklearn’s library and compare these with the manual algorithms.  For these exercises I use various python packages including (but not limited to) numpy, pandas, scipy, and sklearn. Visualizations are implemented using matplotlib and seaborn. 

The topics covered in these notebooks are 
1. Simple Linear Regression 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-Class Logistic Regression with Regularization
4. Neural Networks
5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance
6. Support Vector Machines
7a. K-means Clustering
7b. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
8a. Anomaly Detection
8b. Collaborative Filtering and Recommender Systems

Feel free to take a look, and please let me know if you have any suggestions/comments!
